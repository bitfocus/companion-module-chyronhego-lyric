See below for \nA macro subroutine that is built via Intelligent Interface is not loaded into the Macros dialog box, and therefore does not appear in the dialog box. \nA macro subroutine that is successfully sent to Lyric can be overwritten, i.e., subsequent macros that are sent can have the same name.  The name restriction applies only to macros that are listed in the Macro dialog box.\nAdditionally, if the macro engine is reset, the script must be resent.\nThe E command can also trigger a loaded macro by executing its Hot Key.  Suppose that a macro script in Lyric is assigned the hot key trigger Alt + 3, meaning that it executes when Alt + 3 is pressed.  The following example uses a VB Script command to set up a shell object that passes commands to the Windows command interpreter.
